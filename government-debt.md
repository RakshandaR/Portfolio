### General Government Debt

This particular bargraph displays the government debt for various countries. The X-axis displayes the various country names and the Y-axis tells about Total % of GDP. 
This particular snapshot is for the year 2019.
For this project data from 1995 - 2019 has been used for analysis.
The highlighted countries are of more interest than the ones marked by Grey.

### General Government Debt (1995 - 2019)

In this particular analysis of government debt for various countries is done using _**Line Graph**_.
Debt does not exactly reperesent a positive emotion, hence a shade of Purple has been choosen to help display this complex feeling. A light color might have been suitable, but the information needs to be easy to perceive and at the same time we would want to distingush distinctly with the the grid lines. 

The line graph is easy to interpret and allows for a neat and clean deduction about how the data changes over a period od time and gives a defined region when analysing the highs and lows for a given data set. It can be said to be more easy to read than the Bar Graph due to how the information is represented and the points at which it intersects the grid lines make for a better analysis than the flat head of the bar graph which might confuse us when two quantitiies as very close to one another. They might be mistaken to be of the same value. Such errors can be prevented in Line Graph.

### General Government Debt (2019)

In this particular analysis of government debt for various countries is done using _**Multi - Line Graph**_.
This graph is a little development from the single line graph plotted before. 
This Multi - Line graph utlizies multiple lines to display the various contries in the dataset and the highlighted line (or the colored line) represents the specific country being compared with the other countries. 
This graph allows user to retrive information of a specific country as compared to others without getting lost in the overlapping due to other lines.

### General Government Debt (1995 - 2019)

In this particular analysis of government debt for various countries is done using _**Pie Chart**_.
This Pie Chart represents the debt incurred by each country in a given year.
Countries have been depicted by a unique color. 
The "Play" bar on the left corner helps control the time frame. Use will be able to interact with the bar at any instance and hover over the pie chart to get more information about any country in specififc, the numbers will be highlighted further.
The overall graph thus continue to show the figures for other countries.

For this analysis this style of Pie Chart has been used because it allows user to have a through analysis of various countries with respect to various years. The option to pause on the play bar and then interact with the data is really cool as that helps to engage the user further.

When compared to other graphs, reading a Pie chart might be a little challenging if more data exists as the portion on the chart will reduce. Here it helps with visulalization as larger the portion of the Pie chart a country occupies, the more debt it has incurred. It is not necessary to look at the numbers, but the clour will be enough to point out the major differences.
It might be difficult though when the data figures would be very close to each other.
