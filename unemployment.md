# Introduction
The United States is seen as a developed and fairly advanced country by the other nations. While one may expect that everything about this country might be perfect, the unemployment rates from the past weren't.
Highlighting the details of the graph that caught my attention, to puruse analyzing and then further critiquing are a few.
  - The overall color pallete that has been chosen to represent the data.
  - The focus that is being drawn away from the main information - the trend line
  - The data representation on the Y-axis

It was a surprise to know that the popular, and what people think is a reliable source of News, FOX NEWS, was manipulating the data in a way to alter the visulalizations. This would make us question the reliabilty of any of the other information sources that one puts that faith into.

# Analysis
At first glance, the Unemployment percentage numbers seem to be thrown in someone's eye. It is not that it's bright, but it's neon bright! Those colors just make the user hop from one number to the next without understanding why they are looking at it. Then the attention goes to the White - Silver X-Y axis. No idea why it is so bright and stands out. Just grasping a lot of attention and away from the graph, the trend line which is the actual highlight, the actual information that needs to be conveyed. 
Next, very bright color for the background is used, and a dark shade of red is used for the graph as well, due to which it gets mixed up with the dark blue background. 
The grid lines get hidden due to the background color and difficult to notice where they intersect. At this point, they are just adding to the chaos in the graph.
The red dots used for marking the number also seem very bright. And they didn't have to be so big. It might just confuse the reader which is the exact point that needs to be marked. 
There could be a Y-axis label that would say "As Percentage" to make the Y-axis less cluttered. The numbering of percentages starts from 8, which does not make sense. Hence the intensity of the graph seems to be changed if the Y-axis starts from 0. The results are different, and the graph starting from 0% will be more coherent.

# User Interaction Feedback

#### Can you tell me what you think this is?
The readers found the visualization easy to read and correctly identified that the graph talked about the Unemployment Rate in 2011, when Obama was the President. 
<br />
<br />

#### Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
The users described that the graph told them about the unemployment rate which varied mostly between 8-9% during the time when Obama was the President in 2011.
<br />
<br />

#### Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
The huge gap between the trend line and the months on X-axis made it little difficult after a point, to exactly find the point of intersection with the Y-axis.
<br />
<br />

#### Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
The users saw it more as a general information for any individual.
<br />
<br />

#### Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Addition of a grid line parallel to Y-axis was the inferred solution from the problem mentioned by the readers.
