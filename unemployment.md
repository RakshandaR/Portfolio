The United States is seen as a developed and fairly advanced country by the other nations. While one may expect that everything about this country might be perfect, the unemployment rates from the past weren't.
Highlighting the details of the graph that caught my attention, to puruse analyzing and then further critiquing are a few.
  - The overall color pallete that has been chosen to represent the data.
  - The focus that is being drawn away from the main information - the trend line
  - The data representation on the Y-axis

It was a surprise to know that the popular, and what people think is a reliable source of News, FOX NEWS, was manipulating the data in a way to alter the visulalizations. This would make us question the reliabilty of any of the other information sources that one puts that faith into.
